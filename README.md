# Enhancing Short-Term Commuter Flow Predictions with LSTM Neural Networks

## Project Objective

The project aims to enhance short-term commuter flow predictions in urban metro stations. By leveraging advanced neural network models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the project seeks to improve accuracy and efficiency in predicting daily commuter patterns, which in turn can aid in optimizing rail transit operations and reducing urban traffic congestion.

## Dataset

### PassengerFlow Dataset

- The dataset includes attributes such as station name, date, time, and the number of passengers. Each entry corresponds to a specific interval, capturing the flow of commuters.
- This dataset provides detailed historical data on passenger flow, essential for training the LSTM model. The time series nature of the data allows for the application of LSTM networks, which are adept at handling sequential data, to predict fluctuations in commuter traffic effectively.

## Steps followed

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Included cleaning, normalizing, and transforming the data into a suitable format for the LSTM model.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Involved selecting relevant features and transforming them to enhance model predictions.
3. **Model Development:** Designed and implemented the LSTM model using Python and TensorFlow.
4. **Training and Testing:** The LSTM model was trained on the processed data using an Adaptive Moment Estimation optimizer to minimize prediction errors. Divided the data into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
5. **Result Visualization:** Assessed the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure its efficacy in making predictions. Predictions were visualized and compared against actual data to assess the model's performance.

## Results

The LSTM model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting commuter flow patterns, achieving a prediction accuracy rate of approximately 95%. The results showed significant improvements over traditional models, particularly in handling large fluctuations in data, thereby supporting efficient urban transit management.
